# Philips Hue Spookinator
A simple python script to make your Philips Hue lamps more spooky by adding random flicker effects.

The script works by sending simple requests to the Hue API. You need to supply your own username and IP for the Hue Bridge. 
There are two special events but you can simple add more if you want.
